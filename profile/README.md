### Tokfinity Mission

Founded in 2025, Tokfinity is dedicated to B2B AI-Agent solutions with a primary focus on software R&D (AI coding) scenarios. Guided by the mission to “enable every team to have a deployable AI engineer,” we build an enterprise-grade productivity platform that is trustworthy, controllable, and measurable, helping customers achieve lower cost, higher efficiency, and better quality in highly regulated environments.

### Open Philosophy

We believe AI is reshaping how software is built. With our proprietary platform InfCode, enterprises can deeply integrate large models into their development workflows with lower barriers and greater efficiency, bringing AI directly to engineering execution.

### Vision and Objectives 

Our vision is for every engineering team to have its own AI engineer.
Through continuous innovation, Tokfinity enables organisations to rapidly achieve intelligence, standardisation, and automation across complex IT systems—reducing development barriers and unlocking organisational potential.

We champion openness and co-creation to advance the AI R&D ecosystem. Developers, enterprises, and partners are invited to participate, share feedback, and grow together as we build a trustworthy era of AI engineering. 🚀
